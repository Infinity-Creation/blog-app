## Intro

I Have A lot of experience when it comes to coding, as it is something I’ve been doing for about 3 years, first with Scratch and later with more serious programming languages such as JavaScript. It’s very hard to stay motivated to keep coding even when everything you’ve done doesn’t work, believe it or not, it happened to me just like it happens to many other coders.

## Step 1: Mindset

To be and stay motivated while coding is a question of, first of all, your mindset. Your mindset is how you initially think of what you will be doing before you even write the first letter in your code editor. A key component of staying motivated later on, even when encountering big problems, is how you think of what you will be doing.

What I usually do for myself, so that I don’t end up replicating the man in the world famous meme with the man who gets angry and hits his computer off the table, breaking it in the process. My point is, your mindset shouldn’t be: “I have to do this or else I will have done nothing” but: “I’m doing this, but even if I don’t succeed I will still be closer to solving the problem”

## Step 2: Action is key

Many people, including myself, often found themselves in a state of resignation and chose not to make any attempts to resolve the problem they were facing. Consequently, a significant number of individuals, myself included, resorted to becoming semi-sedentary individuals who passively consume various forms of media rather than actively engaging in coding or problem-solving activities.

When you take action (in this case, coding) and make an effort to do something, you are still attempting to solve the problem but may require more time and resources. However, if you are a couch potato, it is a completely different story. You are not even making an effort to confront the problem you have and instead, simply indulge in watching TV or consuming other internet content.

Being a couch potato is not the best experience I’ve had, so I really want to tell you, do not live through this phase, you lose time of your only time to be alive and you will never be able to do anything after you’re dead.

## Step 3: Confront the problem

This is the last and most crucial step to resolve the issue of being demotivated while coding you have to confront the problem you were facing all this time, the very problem that made you give up in the first place. Maybe read a bit more on the issue on the internet.

There are plenty of helpful websites for you such as [Stackoverflow.com](http://Stackoverflow.com), blog posts, and even social media networks that can help you resolve your issue.

## Conclusion

As you have just read, it is quite simple to address your concerns about motivation in coding. I hope you all have a wonderful time staying motivated once again.
