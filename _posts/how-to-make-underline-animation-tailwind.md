## Intro
In this article I'll be explaining how to make an underline animation in Tailwindcss. 

## Initial Layout
First we'll add a `<div>` to our HTML document and then put a link `<a>` into the `<div>` as shown below. Also add a class attribute to the `<a>` element, but leave it empty for now.

```xml
<div>
<a href="" class=""></a>
</div>
```
