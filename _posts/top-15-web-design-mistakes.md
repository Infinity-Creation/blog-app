You've probably seen some bad websites while surfing the internet, but did you understand why they were bad? In this article I've created a list of all the most common UI design mistakes that inexperienced designers make.

## Center Alignment

Center alignment can be aesthetically pleasing in certain contexts, but it becomes problematic with lengthy paragraphs. The inconsistency of the starting points of the lines makes extended text blocks difficult to read, causing eye strain and reducing overall readability.

## Splash Screens

Splash screens introduce an extra step before users can access your website. Many visitors might mistake the splash page for the entire site and leave prematurely, resulting in a drop in visitor engagement. It's crucial to streamline entry points to keep users on your site.

## Slow Loading Animations

Users appreciate websites that provide information quickly. Long-loading animations can frustrate visitors, leading to impatience and potentially driving them away. Prioritize efficiency to enhance the user experience and retain visitor interest.

## Marquees

Horizontally scrolling marquee animations are considered outdated and often annoy users. They are also challenging to read. Instead, consider using a modern animation like a typewriter effect, which is more engaging and user-friendly.

## Custom Cursor

A custom cursor can be particularly irritating, especially if it changes based on the element you are hovering over. This inconsistency can make the user experience (UX) unpleasant and detract from the overall functionality of your website.

## Dropdowns on Click

Dropdown menus should be easily accessible as they are integral to site navigation. Making them appear on hover rather than on click eliminates an unnecessary step, streamlining the userâ€™s journey and enhancing usability.

## Taking over Scrolling

Hijacking the scrolling function on your website can significantly degrade the user experience. It effectively turns your site into a vertical PowerPoint presentation, which can be frustrating and disorienting for users.

## Only making the Navbar appear on Vertical Scrolling

If your navbar only appears when the user scrolls up, it adds an extra step to access navigation. This design choice can hinder smooth navigation and frustrate users, making your site less intuitive to use.

## Using Emojis

While emojis are great for casual conversations, they come off as unprofessional in a website context. Avoid using them to maintain credibility and present a polished, professional image to your visitors.

## Not using Common Web Design Standards

Ignoring common web design standards can confuse users. Placing your logo in an unconventional location or positioning the footer oddly doesn't make your site unique; it simply makes it harder for users to find information efficiently.

## Long Boring Animations

Lengthy animations that do not contribute to the user experience are unnecessary. They waste users' time and can lead to frustration. Focus on concise, purposeful animations that enhance the site's functionality.

## Navbar only at the Top of the Page

Limiting your navbar to the top of the page reduces navigation flexibility. Users should have easy access to navigation options without needing to scroll back to the top, enhancing their overall experience.

## Horizontal Scrolling

Horizontal scrolling is not intuitive for most users and can be mistaken for a lack of content. It also makes your website resemble a PowerPoint presentation, which is not a user-friendly design choice.

## Small Home Pages

A home page that is too small fails to provide sufficient information about your services. Users might leave quickly if they don't get the information they need immediately, leading to a higher bounce rate.

## Pre Loaders

Rather than relying on pre-loaders to mask slow load times, focus on optimizing your website's speed. Faster loading times improve user experience and ensure visitors stay on your site longer.

## Conclusion

In web design, small details can make a big difference. Avoiding common pitfalls like splash screens, non-standard navigation, and slow-loading elements can greatly improve user experience. Focus on making your site intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly. By keeping design choices simple and user-centric, you'll create a website that both looks good and performs well. Happy designing!
